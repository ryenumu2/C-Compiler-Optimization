## Results

Optimizations are recorded by incrementing output counters *CSE_Dead*, *CSE_Basic*, and *CSE_Simplify*. These variables displayed the number of dead code eliminations, constant foldings, and subexpression eliminations respectively after running these optimization files over any given piece of code. An example output on terminal after optimizations are done is as shown:
